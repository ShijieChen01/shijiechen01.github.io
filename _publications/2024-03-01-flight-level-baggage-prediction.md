This article presents a machine‑learning approach to predicting the number of checked bags on individual flights. By leveraging historical data and advanced feature engineering, the model improves forecast accuracy and helps airline operations reduce mishandled baggage costs. The work demonstrates how data‑driven methods can enhance operational decision‑making in the aviation industry.
