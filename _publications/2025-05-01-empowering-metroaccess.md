excerpt: 'Developed a nested decomposition method that embeds a column‑generation solution within a temporal decomposition framework and integrates alternative service types such as accessible taxis. Deployment in the Washington, DC metro area yielded significant improvements in key operational metrics and ~15 % cost reductions【731632899040982†L88-L104】.'

This paper addresses the operational and financial challenges faced by paratransit services. Through a university–industry collaboration, we modernize the optimization engine in paratransit scheduling software and incorporate alternative service providers, including accessible taxis. The proposed nested decomposition method embeds a column‑generation–based solution within a temporal decomposition framework. Deployed in the Washington, DC metro area, the new optimization engine significantly improves key operational metrics and reduces operating costs by roughly 15 %【731632899040982†L88-L104】.
