excerpt: 'Introduces a nonconvex mixed‑integer nonlinear formulation and a fix‑and‑optimize algorithm for negotiating pickup times with ADA paratransit riders, explicitly incorporating privately held value‑of‑time information. Case studies demonstrate substantial improvements in operational efficiency【396237119823057†L69-L90】.'

When ADA paratransit riders book trips, operators often adjust pickup times for efficiency. Existing literature lacks optimization methods for this schedule negotiation. This work formulates a new mathematical model and a decomposition‑based fix‑and‑optimize algorithm that jointly determines accommodation and incentive design while explicitly considering riders’ privately held value of time. The proposed method, validated through synthetic analyses and real‑world case studies, significantly enhances paratransit operational efficiency【396237119823057†L69-L90】.
