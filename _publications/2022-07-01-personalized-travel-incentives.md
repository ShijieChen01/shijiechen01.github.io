excerpt: |
  Dynamic carpooling programs match drivers and riders on short notice and can
  reduce vehicle miles travelled when participants are willing to adjust
  departure or destination plans.  This paper formulates a coordinated
  matching and incentive allocation problem where the coordinator decides
  monetary incentives for drivers and riders, trip assignments and vehicle
  routes.  A case study in Washington, D.C. evaluates the potential of
  personalized incentives to improve environmental performance.  The authors
  show that one dollar of incentive can reduce vehicle miles travelled by
  approximately 2.88 in a benchmark case and that driver incentives are
  generally more effective than rider incentives【264317520455923†L61-L82】.
  The study demonstrates the environmental benefits of incentive‑driven
  dynamic carpooling and informs practitioners designing multimodal mobility
  platforms.

This paper investigates how personalized monetary incentives offered to drivers
and riders can enhance the environmental benefits of dynamic carpooling.  The
coordinator optimizes incentives, trip assignments and vehicle routes to
minimize total vehicle miles travelled while maintaining participant welfare.
Through a case study in Washington, D.C., the authors find that modest
incentives can substantially reduce travel distances, with driver incentives
yielding greater reductions than rider incentives【264317520455923†L61-L82】.  The
findings inform transportation planners and mobility‑as‑a‑service (MaaS)
platforms seeking to promote sustainable carpooling through incentive
mechanisms.
