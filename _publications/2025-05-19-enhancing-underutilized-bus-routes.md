The paper proposes converting conventional bus routes into semiflexible systems in which passengers provide advance notice of intended stops. This allows buses to skip downstream stops without demand by taking shortcuts, increasing stop density while maintaining operational efficiency. Optimization models maximize the number of stops subject to route duration and arrival‑time constraints. A case study in Allegany County, Maryland shows that routes with high probabilities of vacant stops and conducive layouts can increase the number of served stops by up to 160 %【288059446295939†L126-L140】.
