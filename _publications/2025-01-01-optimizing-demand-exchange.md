Independent paratransit operators often miss opportunities to rebalance trips and share demand. In this work we design a platform that optimizes the exchange of trip requests among carriers while accounting for the probabilistic responses of riders to schedule adjustments. The model uses column generation and valid inequalities to produce exchange bundles and aims to maximize collective payoff and fleet utilization. At the time of writing the paper is under review for publication in <i>Transportation Science</i>.
