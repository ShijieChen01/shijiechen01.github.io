The ability to monitor bus occupancy in real time enables better service planning and improved passenger information. This work investigates using Wi‑Fi probe data collected from mobile devices and machine‑learning algorithms to estimate passenger counts on buses. The proposed approach offers a low‑cost alternative to traditional counting hardware and is currently under review for publication.
