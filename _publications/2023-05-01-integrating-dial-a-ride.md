This study explores outsourcing certain dial‑a‑ride (DAR) trips to transportation network companies to minimize service delivery costs. A two‑stage solution framework re‑optimizes individual routes with trip outsourcing and then uses a multi‑vehicle heuristic to reinsert outsourced trips and exchange remaining trips among routes. When applied to a medium‑sized DAR operator in Maryland, the approach yields cost reductions of 7–13 %, depending on negotiated TNC volume discounts【10820558356593†L70-L84】.
