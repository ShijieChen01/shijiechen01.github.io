## Profile

- **Background & Education**  
  Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering, Florida State University; Operations research specialist with 6+ years’ experience, deploying advanced analytics and optimization in transportation and logistics.

- **Core Interests**  
  - **Transportation System Optimization** (scheduling, routing, fleet sizing)  
  - **Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics** (demand forecasting, evacuation planning)  
  - **Machine Learning & AI** for real-time decision support  
  - **Multi-Modal Coordination** (paratransit, last-mile logistics)

- **Technical Expertise**  
  - **Languages & Libraries:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, NLTK), SQL, MATLAB, R  
  - **Optimization & Solvers:** GAMS, CPLEX, Gurobi  
  - **Data & Geospatial:** GTFS, GeoPandas  
  - **Software Engineering:** API design, Git

- **Hands-On Experience & Impact**  
  - **$4 M+ annual operating savings (15 % cost reduction & 10 % on-time performance gain):** Led the design and deployment of a nested-decomposition GAMS scheduling engine with dynamic dispatch API, integrating taxis, ride-hailing, and traditional vehicles to drive measurable cost and service improvements.
  - **Enhanced baggage forecasting & cost mitigation:** Collaborated with a major airline company to develop, validate and deploy flight-level checked-baggage prediction models; boost forecast accuracy and reduce mishandled-baggage costs in their operations dashboard.
  - **Scalable real-time dispatch APIs:** Architected and delivered production-ready dispatching and matching services for paratransit, supporting multi-modal vehicle fleets.
  - **Stochastic schedule negotiation under uncertainty:** Formulated a nonconvex MINLP with 17+ constraints and implemented a fix-and-optimize heuristic for real-time rider schedule adjustments—achieving a 3.5× ROI, cutting average solution time by 30 %, and increasing rider acceptance by 20 %.



- **Collaboration & Leadership**  
  - Cross-functional team collaboration: Engineers, planners, data scientists, and stakeholders at a transit consulting company and a paratransit operator.  
  - Presented findings at INFORMS and TRB; authored 10+ peer-reviewed publications on transit optimization and machine learning.

- **Career Objectives**  
  Seeking a challenging role, such as **Optimization Engineer**, **Transportation Analytics Consultant**, **Operations Research Lead**, or **Data Scientist**, where I can leverage my blend of academic rigor and industry impact to drive measurable efficiencies and strategic insights in transportation and logistics.
