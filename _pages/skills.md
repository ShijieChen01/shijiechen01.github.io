* **MATLAB** – rapid prototyping for numerical optimization and simulation
* **SQL** – relational data modelling and performant query design
* **R** – statistical analysis and visualization

#### Data Science & Machine Learning

* **NumPy**, **Pandas** & **SciPy** – data wrangling and scientific computing
* **Scikit‑learn**, **TensorFlow** & **PyTorch** – predictive modelling and deep learning
* **Keras** – rapid neural network prototyping
* **NLTK**, **spaCy** – natural language processing

#### Optimization & Mathematical Modelling

* **GAMS**, **Pyomo**, **CPLEX**, **Gurobi** – formulating and solving linear, integer and nonlinear programs
* Column generation, decomposition techniques and Benders cuts
* Metaheuristic and matheuristic algorithms (e.g., fix‑and‑optimize, tabu search)
* Network flow and scheduling models

#### Software Engineering & Tools

* **Git**, **GitHub** – version control and collaborative development
* **Docker**, **Linux** – containerization and deployment on cloud platforms
* **AWS** (EC2, S3) – cloud computing and storage
